# Cost-of-Living-Index-Analysis-over-2010-2019

https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/rankings.jsp?title=2019

I have taken this data set using web scraping from the years 2010-2020. 

I have answered some of the following questions:
--What countries/cities have the highest/lowest mean of each index?
--What countries/cities had the highest/lowest change of each index over the years?
--What countries have the highest disparity of each cost index?

In particular, this was interesting to me because while I was born in NYC, my parents rented and had to leave. Now that I live here on my own, I often wonder how normal it is for rents to keep increasing this much! 

Challenges I faced
--Formatting data correctly
--Splitting the city column into multiple columns (some cities have State level reporting and some don't)
--Working with pivots and pivot table 
--Removing cities that do not represent a full data set (missing in some years)

TLDR: America is crazy expensive to rent in!
